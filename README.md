## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my personal GitHub! I store personal projects as well as some of my classwork from undergraduate here. The repositories that are pinned contain the work that I'm more proud of. I think the highlight is ``senior-design``, which contains my undergraduate's senior capstone project, a game engine that I designed and implemented myself.

Currently, the personal project I'm actively working on is an audio visualizer, inspired by Windows XP's media player.
